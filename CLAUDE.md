# Gmail MCP Server — Setup Guide

You are helping a user set up the Gmail MCP server so Claude Desktop can read, send, and manage their email.

## Update your plan

After reading this file, immediately update your task plan to reflect these steps:

1. Check working directory (sandbox vs real folder)
2. Ask for connection name (personal, work, etc.)
3. Download and extract the project
4. Check for Node.js (help install if missing)
5. Get Google credentials (guide through Google Cloud Console)
6. Install dependencies (npm install)
7. Build the project (npm run build)
8. Google authorization (user runs in Terminal)
9. Configure Claude Desktop (add config entry)
10. Verify it works (hammer icon)
11. Ask about additional accounts

---

## How to guide the user

- Walk through each step one at a time. Do NOT skip ahead or dump all steps at once.
- After each step, confirm it worked before moving on.
- Be friendly, patient, and encouraging. Assume the user has never used a terminal before.
- If something fails, help them troubleshoot — don't just say "it failed."
- When you run commands, explain what you're doing in plain English first.
- Always use the absolute path to this project folder when constructing commands or config.
- **CRITICAL: You may be running inside a sandbox.** Files you create in the sandbox are NOT visible on the user's actual Mac. You MUST work inside the user's selected folder — never download or build anything outside of it. All files (the project, node_modules, dist, config) must live in the user's real filesystem.
- **IMPORTANT: All commands must be run inside the project folder.** Before running ANY command, always `cd` into the project directory first. Every shell command block should start with `cd /path/to/gmail-mcp && ...`. Never assume the shell is already in the right directory.

## Before you start

### Step 0: Determine your working directory

**This is the most important step.** Run `pwd` to find out where you are.

- If you are in a user-selected folder (e.g., `/Users/username/Documents`, `/Users/username/Desktop`, or similar), you are in the right place. The project will be downloaded into this folder.
- If you are in a sandbox path (e.g., `/private/var/folders/...`, `/tmp/...`, or anything that doesn't look like a normal user folder), **STOP**. Tell the user:

> "I'm currently running in a temporary sandbox, which means any files I create here won't be visible on your Mac. We need to fix this first."
>
> 1. "Look at the bottom-left of the chat input box — you should see a **folder icon**"
> 2. "Click it and select a folder on your computer where you'd like the project to live (e.g., your home folder, Documents, or Desktop)"
> 3. "Once you've done that, send me a message and we'll continue"

Wait for them to confirm, then re-run `pwd` to verify you're now in their selected folder.

### Step 0b: Ask for a connection name

Before downloading anything, ask the user what to call this connection:

> "This will let Claude Desktop read, search, send, and manage your Gmail. Before we start — what would you like to name this connection? For example:"
>
> - **"personal"** — for your personal Gmail
> - **"work"** — for your work/company email
> - Or any name that makes sense to you
>
> "This name will help you tell your accounts apart if you connect more than one later."

Wait for their answer. Use their chosen name as **CONNECTION_NAME** throughout the rest of the setup. This name will be used for:
- The config directory: `config/CONNECTION_NAME/`
- The Claude Desktop config entry: `"CONNECTION_NAME-gmail"`
- The `--name` flag: `--name CONNECTION_NAME-gmail`
- The auth command the user runs in Terminal

### Download the project into the user's folder

Once you've confirmed you're in the user's real folder and have the connection name, download and extract the project into the current directory:

```
curl -L https://github.com/xorbh/gmail-mcp/archive/refs/heads/master.zip -o gmail-mcp.zip && unzip gmail-mcp.zip && mv gmail-mcp-master gmail-mcp && rm gmail-mcp.zip
```

Then get the absolute path — this is your **PROJECT_PATH** for the rest of the setup:
```
cd gmail-mcp && pwd
```

Save this path. You'll use it in every subsequent command, in Step 5 (auth), and in Step 6 (Claude Desktop config).

Then create the config directory for this connection:
```
mkdir -p config/CONNECTION_NAME
```

### If the project IS already downloaded:

If the project folder already exists in the user's directory, determine its absolute path and use it for all subsequent commands. Still ask for the connection name and create the config directory.

### Then start the guided setup:

> "Great! I'll set up your **CONNECTION_NAME** Gmail connection step by step. It should take about 15 minutes. Let's start!"

Then begin with Step 1.

---

## Step 1: Check for Node.js

Run `node --version` to see if Node.js is installed.

### If Node.js IS found:
Tell the user: "Great, you have Node.js [version] installed. Let's move on."

### If Node.js is NOT found:
Tell the user they need to install Node.js first. Walk them through it based on their platform:

**Detect their platform** by checking `uname` output.

### Mac installation — give them TWO options:

**Option A — Download from website (easiest for beginners):**
1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Click the big green **LTS** button to download
3. Open the downloaded `.pkg` file
4. Follow the installer — just click Continue/Agree/Install through each screen
5. It may ask for your password — that's normal, type your Mac login password
6. When it says "Installation was successful", click Close

**Option B — Install via Homebrew (if they already have it):**
Run `brew --version` to check. If they have Homebrew:
```
brew install node
```

After either option, **important**: tell them that the Terminal session needs to be refreshed. Run `hash -r` or tell them to type `hash -r` and press Enter. Then re-check `node --version`.

If it still doesn't work after installing, the most common issue is that the Terminal needs to be fully closed and reopened. Ask them to:
1. Quit Terminal completely (Cmd+Q)
2. Reopen Terminal
3. Come back to this Claude Desktop conversation and tell you they're ready

Then re-check `node --version`.

### Windows installation:
1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Click the big green **LTS** button to download
3. Run the downloaded `.msi` file
4. Follow the installer — accept defaults, click Next through each screen
5. **Important:** Check the box that says "Automatically install the necessary tools" if it appears
6. **Restart your computer** after the installer finishes
7. Come back here after restarting

Then re-check `node --version`.

### Linux installation:
```
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
Or if they use a different distro, point them to https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager

---

## Step 2: Check for credentials.json

Check if the file exists in these locations (in order):
1. `config/CONNECTION_NAME/credentials.json` (relative to this project folder)
2. `credentials.json` in the project root folder

### If found in project root but NOT in config/CONNECTION_NAME:
```
mkdir -p config/CONNECTION_NAME
cp credentials.json config/CONNECTION_NAME/credentials.json
```
Tell the user: "Found your credentials file — I've put it in the right place."

### If found in config/CONNECTION_NAME:
Tell the user: "Your credentials file is already in place. Let's move on."

### If NOT found anywhere:
Tell the user: "We need to set up Google credentials. This is a one-time thing — I'll walk you through it step by step."

Then guide them through these sub-steps. **Give them ONE sub-step at a time, not all at once.** Wait for them to confirm each one before moving to the next.

#### Sub-step 2a: Create a Google Cloud Project
Tell them:
1. Open this link in your browser: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Sign in with the Google account whose Gmail you want Claude to access
3. Near the top of the page, you'll see a project dropdown (it might say "Select a project" or show an existing project name). Click on it.
4. In the popup, click **New Project** (top right corner)
5. For the project name, type: `My MCP Servers`
6. Click **Create**
7. Wait a moment, then click the project dropdown again and select **My MCP Servers** to make sure it's active

**If they already set up a project for Google Drive MCP:** Tell them they can reuse the same project — just skip to Sub-step 2b.

Ask: "Let me know when you've done this and I'll tell you the next step."

#### Sub-step 2b: Turn on the Gmail API
Tell them:
1. In the search bar at the very top of the Google Cloud Console page, type: `Gmail API`
2. Click on **Gmail API** in the search results (it should be under "Marketplace")
3. Click the blue **Enable** button
4. Wait until the page changes to show "API enabled" or takes you to the API dashboard

Ask: "Done? Let me know and we'll continue."

#### Sub-step 2c: Set up the OAuth consent screen
Tell them:
1. In the left sidebar, click **APIs & Services**, then click **OAuth consent screen**
2. Click **Get started**
3. Fill in these fields:
   - **App name:** type `MCP Server`
   - **User support email:** click the dropdown and pick your email address
   - **Audience:** select **External**
4. Click **Next** or **Save and Continue**
5. On the **Scopes** page:
   - Click **Add or remove scopes**
   - In the search/filter box, type `Gmail`
   - Look for these scopes and check all of them:
     - `../auth/gmail.readonly`
     - `../auth/gmail.send`
     - `../auth/gmail.modify`
     - `../auth/gmail.labels`
   - Click **Update** at the bottom
   - Click **Save and Continue**
6. On the **Test users** page:
   - Click **Add users**
   - Type your Gmail address (the one you signed in with)
   - Click **Add**
   - Click **Save and Continue**
7. On the summary page, click **Back to Dashboard**

**If they already set up the consent screen for Drive MCP:** Tell them they just need to add the Gmail scopes. Go to **OAuth consent screen** → **Data Access** → **Add or remove scopes** and add the 4 Gmail scopes listed above.

Ask: "All done? Just one more sub-step to get your credentials file."

#### Sub-step 2d: Create and download the credentials file
Tell them:
1. In the left sidebar, click **APIs & Services**, then click **Credentials**
2. Near the top, click **+ Create Credentials**
3. Choose **OAuth client ID** from the dropdown
4. For **Application type**, select **Desktop app**
5. For **Name**, you can type anything — like `MCP Desktop Client`
6. Click **Create**
7. A popup will appear showing your client ID — click **Download JSON**
8. A file will download with a long name like `client_secret_xxxxx.json`

**If they already created credentials for Drive MCP:** Tell them they can reuse the same credentials file. Go to Google Cloud Console → Credentials → click the download icon next to the existing OAuth client to download it again.

Then tell them:

> "Now **drag and drop that downloaded file right into this chat window**. I'll rename it and put it in the right place for you."

When they drop the file, it will appear as an attachment in the conversation. Save it to the project folder as `credentials.json`:
```
cp /path/to/dropped/file config/CONNECTION_NAME/credentials.json
```

The dropped file path will be visible in the attachment. Use that path to copy it into the config directory. Verify it's valid JSON by reading it and checking it has `client_id` and `client_secret` fields.

If they can't drag and drop (e.g., they're not in a folder session, or it doesn't work), fall back to:
> "No worries! Just rename the file to `credentials.json` and move it into this project folder. Let me know when you've done that and I'll verify it."

Then re-check for the file in the project root and move it into place:
```
mkdir -p config/CONNECTION_NAME
cp credentials.json config/CONNECTION_NAME/credentials.json
```

---

## Step 3: Install dependencies

Tell the user: "Now I'm going to install the required packages. This might take a minute."

Run:
```
cd PROJECT_PATH && npm install
```

### If it succeeds:
Tell the user: "Dependencies installed. Let's move on."

### If it fails:
Common issues:
- **EACCES / permission errors:** Try `sudo npm install` (Mac/Linux) or tell them to run their terminal as Administrator (Windows)
- **Network errors:** Ask if they're behind a corporate firewall or VPN
- **Other errors:** Try cleaning and retrying:
  ```
  cd PROJECT_PATH && rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install
  ```

---

## Step 4: Build the project

Tell the user: "Now I'll compile the project."

Run:
```
cd PROJECT_PATH && npm run build
```

### If it succeeds:
Tell the user: "Build complete. Now for the fun part — connecting to your Google account."

### If it fails:
Show the error and help them fix it. Most common cause is a TypeScript version issue — try `npm install typescript@latest` then rebuild.

---

## Step 5: Google Authorization

**Do NOT try to run the auth command yourself.** The auth process needs to listen on localhost for Google's callback, which doesn't work from within Claude Desktop's sandbox. The user must run this command in their own Terminal.

Tell the user:

> "This next step connects to your Google account. I can't run this one for you because it needs to listen for Google's response on your computer. But don't worry — it's just one command!"
>
> "Open **Terminal** on your Mac (you can find it in Applications → Utilities, or just search for 'Terminal' in Spotlight with Cmd+Space)."
>
> "Then paste this command:"

Give them the exact command with the **absolute PROJECT_PATH** you saved from Step 0:

```
cd PROJECT_PATH && npm run auth -- --config-dir config/CONNECTION_NAME
```

Then tell them:

> "After you paste that and press Enter:"
>
> 1. "Your browser should open with a Google sign-in page"
> 2. "If it doesn't open automatically, a URL will appear in Terminal — copy and paste it into your browser"
> 3. "Sign in with the same Google account you used to set up the Cloud project"
> 4. "You might see a warning that says **'Google hasn't verified this app'** — this is totally normal! You made this app yourself. Click **Advanced**, then click **Go to MCP Server (unsafe)** — it's completely safe."
> 5. "Click **Allow**"
> 6. "You should see **'Authorization successful!'** in your browser"
> 7. "Come back here and let me know when it's done!"

### After they confirm it worked:
Verify the token file exists:
```
ls PROJECT_PATH/config/CONNECTION_NAME/token.json
```
If it exists, tell them: "Excellent! Your Google account is connected. Almost done!"

### If they say it failed:
- **"command not found: node"** — They need to close and reopen Terminal after installing Node.js, or their PATH isn't set up. See Step 1 troubleshooting.
- **"redirect_uri_mismatch"** — Their OAuth client was created as "Web application" instead of "Desktop app". Guide them back to Google Cloud Console → Credentials → delete it → create a new one as **Desktop app**.
- **Port already in use** — Another process is using port 3847. Ask them to close other Terminal windows that might be running this, then try again.
- **Browser didn't open** — Tell them to look for the URL printed in Terminal and copy-paste it into their browser manually.

---

## Step 6: Configure Claude Desktop

Tell the user: "Last step! We need to tell Claude Desktop about this server."

Use the PROJECT_PATH you saved from Step 0. Then tell the user:

1. Open **Claude Desktop** (the app, not this website)
2. Click the **Claude** menu at the top of your screen
3. Click **Settings** (or press **Cmd+,** on Mac / **Ctrl+,** on Windows)
4. Click **Developer** on the left side
5. Click **Edit Config** — this will open a JSON file in a text editor

Now, check what's currently in their config. The file is at:
- **Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Read the file to see if they already have MCP servers configured.

### If the file is empty or has empty `{}`:
Tell them to replace everything with:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "CONNECTION_NAME-gmail": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["PROJECT_PATH/dist/index.js", "--config-dir", "PROJECT_PATH/config/CONNECTION_NAME", "--name", "CONNECTION_NAME-gmail"]
    }
  }
}
```
Replace `PROJECT_PATH` with the actual project path and `CONNECTION_NAME` with the name they chose (e.g., `personal`, `work`).

For example, if they chose "personal" and the project is at `/Users/joe/google-mcps/gmail-mcp`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "personal-gmail": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/joe/google-mcps/gmail-mcp/dist/index.js", "--config-dir", "/Users/joe/google-mcps/gmail-mcp/config/personal", "--name", "personal-gmail"]
    }
  }
}
```

### If they already have other MCP servers:
Tell them to add the `CONNECTION_NAME-gmail` entry inside their existing `"mcpServers"` block, separated by a comma. Show them exactly what the merged config should look like so they don't make a JSON syntax error.

After they've saved the file:

6. **Quit Claude Desktop completely** — not just close the window:
   - **Mac:** Click **Claude** in the menu bar → **Quit Claude**, or press **Cmd+Q**
   - **Windows:** Right-click the Claude icon in the system tray → **Quit**
7. Reopen Claude Desktop

---

## Step 7: Verify it works

Tell the user:

> "Look at the chat input box in Claude Desktop. Do you see a small hammer icon (or a tool icon)? If so, the server is connected and working!"

If they see it, congratulate them and suggest they try:
- "Do I have any unread emails?"
- "Search my email for messages from [someone]"
- "Send an email to bob@example.com saying thanks for lunch"

If they DON'T see it:
- Ask them to double-check they saved the config file
- Ask them to make sure they fully quit and reopened Claude Desktop (not just closing the window)
- Read the config file yourself and check for JSON errors (missing commas, wrong paths, etc.)
- Check that `dist/index.js` exists in the project folder

---

## Step 8: Ask about multiple Google accounts

**This step is NOT optional — always ask this after Step 7 succeeds.**

After the first account is working, ask the user:

> "Great, your Gmail is connected! One more thing — do you have any other Google accounts you'd like to connect? For example, a work account, a school account, or another personal account? Each one would show up as a separate set of tools so you can say things like 'check my work email' or 'send from my personal Gmail.'"

- If they say **no**, you're done! Congratulate them and wrap up.
- If they say **yes**, proceed to the multi-account flow below.

---

## Multi-Account Flow

### Planning phase

Before adding any accounts, figure out the full picture:

1. **Ask how many additional accounts** they want to connect and what they'd like to call each one. For example:
   - "work" (for a company Google Workspace account)
   - "personal" (if the default was their work account)
   - "school" (for a .edu account)
   - Any name they want — it's just a label

2. **Check what profiles already exist** by listing the `config/` directory:
   ```
   ls config/
   ```
   This tells you which profiles are already set up so you don't create duplicates.

3. **Check for naming conflicts.** Since the first account already has a CONNECTION_NAME, make sure the new profile names don't conflict with existing ones.

4. **Make a plan and share it with the user.** For example:
   > "OK, here's my plan: I'll set up 2 additional profiles — 'work' and 'school'. For each one, I'll run the Google sign-in process (you'll need to sign in with that account), and then I'll update the Claude Desktop config with all three accounts at the end. Sound good?"

   Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

### For each additional account, repeat this loop:

Tell the user which account you're setting up now:
> "Let's set up your [PROFILE_NAME] account. This will be quick — we just need to sign in with that Google account."

#### Step A: Create the profile directory
```
mkdir -p config/PROFILE_NAME
cp config/CONNECTION_NAME/credentials.json config/PROFILE_NAME/credentials.json
```

Explain: "I'm creating a separate config for your [PROFILE_NAME] account. The Google credentials file works for any account — it's the sign-in step that determines which account gets connected."

#### Step B: Run authorization

**Do NOT run this yourself — the user must run it in Terminal (same reason as Step 5).**

Tell the user:
> "Open Terminal again and paste this command:"

Give them the exact command with the real PROJECT_PATH:
```
cd PROJECT_PATH && npm run auth -- --config-dir config/PROFILE_NAME
```

Then tell them:
> "**Important: This time, make sure you sign in with your [PROFILE_NAME] Google account** (e.g., your work email), NOT the one you used before."
>
> "If you're already signed into Google in your browser, it might automatically pick the wrong account. Look for a **'Use another account'** option on the Google sign-in page."

Give them the same browser instructions as Step 5 (Google sign-in, "hasn't verified this app" warning, click Allow, etc.).

#### Step C: Verify the token was saved
Check that `config/PROFILE_NAME/token.json` exists. If it does, tell the user:
> "Your [PROFILE_NAME] account is connected!"

#### Step D: Ask if there are more
> "Want to add another account, or is that all?"

If more, loop back to Step A with the next profile name. If done, proceed to the config step.

### After all accounts are set up: Update Claude Desktop config

This is the most important part — do this ONCE at the end, after all accounts are authorized.

1. Get the absolute path with `pwd`.
2. Read the current Claude Desktop config file:
   - **Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

3. Build the complete config with ALL profiles. List the `config/` directory to find every profile that has a `token.json`:
   ```
   ls config/*/token.json
   ```

4. Construct the full `mcpServers` config. The naming convention is:
   - Every profile uses `"PROFILE_NAME-gmail"` as the server name
   - Every profile gets the `--name` flag so Claude can tell the accounts apart

   Example with 3 accounts (personal, work, school):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "personal-gmail": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["PROJECT_PATH/dist/index.js", "--config-dir", "PROJECT_PATH/config/personal", "--name", "personal-gmail"]
       },
       "work-gmail": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["PROJECT_PATH/dist/index.js", "--config-dir", "PROJECT_PATH/config/work", "--name", "work-gmail"]
       },
       "school-gmail": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["PROJECT_PATH/dist/index.js", "--config-dir", "PROJECT_PATH/config/school", "--name", "school-gmail"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Merge carefully** with any existing config. If they already have other MCP servers (like gdrive), keep those entries and add/update only the gmail entries. Show the user the complete final config so they can verify it looks right.

6. Tell the user to save the config, then **quit Claude Desktop completely** (Cmd+Q on Mac) and reopen it.

7. After they reopen, tell them:
   > "You should now see tools from all your connected accounts! You can tell Claude which account to use by saying things like 'check my work email for messages from the boss' or 'send from my personal Gmail.'"

---

## Troubleshooting

If the user runs into problems at any point, here are common fixes:

### "The hammer icon doesn't appear in Claude Desktop"
- Verify the config file was saved (read it and check)
- Verify Claude Desktop was fully quit and reopened (Cmd+Q, not just closing the window)
- Check that the file paths in the config are correct and the files exist
- Check for JSON syntax errors in the config file (missing commas, extra commas, unclosed braces)
- Run `node PROJECT_PATH/dist/index.js --config-dir PROJECT_PATH/config/CONNECTION_NAME` directly to see if there's an error

### "Missing credentials.json" or "Missing token.json"
- Check if the files exist in the config directory
- If credentials.json is missing, they need to go back to Step 2
- If token.json is missing, re-run the auth step (Step 5)

### "Token has been expired or revoked"
- Delete the token file and re-authorize. The user must run the auth command in Terminal:
```
cd PROJECT_PATH && rm config/CONNECTION_NAME/token.json
```
Then have the user run in Terminal:
```
cd PROJECT_PATH && npm run auth -- --config-dir config/CONNECTION_NAME
```

### "Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::3847"
- Another process is using port 3847. Find and stop it:
```
lsof -i :3847
```
- Or wait a moment and try again — a previous auth attempt might still be running

### "redirect_uri_mismatch" error during Google sign-in
- The OAuth client was created as "Web application" instead of "Desktop app"
- Go to Google Cloud Console → Credentials → delete the OAuth client → create a new one as **Desktop app**

### "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid" or "Error 400: admin_policy_enforced"
- If using a work/school Google account, their organization may block third-party apps
- They'll need to use a personal Google account, or ask their IT admin to allow the app

### npm install fails with EACCES
- On Mac/Linux: `sudo npm install`
- Better fix: reconfigure npm to not need sudo: `mkdir ~/.npm-global && npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'` then add `~/.npm-global/bin` to PATH

### "command not found: node" after installing Node.js
- Terminal needs to be restarted. Quit Terminal (Cmd+Q) and reopen it.
- If installed via nvm, they need to run `nvm use default` or add nvm init to their shell profile
- If installed via Homebrew, they may need to run `brew link node`

### The auth process just hangs / browser doesn't open
- The URL should be printed in the terminal output. Tell them to manually copy the entire URL and paste it into their browser.
- If they're on a remote/headless machine, they need to copy the URL to a machine with a browser
