# Gmail MCP Server

Let Claude Desktop read, search, send, and manage your Gmail.

---

## Setup

> **Claude — start here:** Read the [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) file in this project folder. It contains your complete step-by-step instructions for guiding the user through setup, including installing Node.js, getting Google credentials, authorizing, configuring Claude Desktop, adding multiple Google accounts, and troubleshooting. Follow those instructions — do not use this README for setup guidance.

### For users

The easiest way to set up this server is to **let Claude do it for you:**

1. **Start a session in a folder** — In Claude Desktop, click the **folder icon** (bottom-left of the chat input) and select any folder on your computer (e.g., your home folder or Desktop). Claude needs this to run commands on your machine.

2. **Paste this into the chat:**

```
Download https://github.com/xorbh/gmail-mcp/archive/refs/heads/master.zip into ~/mcp-servers/, unzip it, then read the CLAUDE.md file inside and follow its instructions to guide me through setup step by step.
```

That's it — Claude will download everything, then walk you through each step.

### Getting credentials.json

You need a credentials file from Google Cloud Console. If you don't have one yet, Claude will walk you through creating it — just start the setup and follow along.

If you prefer to do it yourself:
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a project (or reuse an existing one)
3. Enable the **Gmail API**
4. Set up the **OAuth consent screen** (External, add your email as a test user, add Gmail scopes)
5. Create an **OAuth client ID** (Desktop app type)
6. Download the JSON and rename it to `credentials.json`

## What you can do

Once set up, ask Claude things like:

- "Do I have any unread emails?"
- "Search my email for messages from Alice"
- "Read my latest email"
- "Send an email to bob@example.com about the meeting tomorrow"
- "Reply to that email and say thanks"
- "Create a draft reply to the last message from my boss"

## Multiple Google Accounts

You can connect more than one Google account (e.g., personal + work). Ask Claude: **"Help me add another Google account"** and it will guide you through creating a new profile.
